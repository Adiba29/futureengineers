-Pixy Camera 2:
   The ability to recognize objects has been a goal of computer scientists and AI researchers for decades. In the past, this has required large computers     running sophisticated software which has kept the technologies involved confined to labs and research departments with large budgets. Pixy is a fast       vision sensor you can quickly “teach” to find objects, and it connects directly to Arduino and other controllers. Pixy uses a hue-based color filtering     algorithm to detect objects. The Pixy2 is a small camera designed for object recognition, line tracking, and simple barcode reading. The Pixy2 is capable   of recognizing seven distinct objects based upon their shape and color (or hue).  Each of these objects is assigned a unique “signature”. The camera also   has algorithms for line following.

-Arduino uno: 
  Arduino UNO is a flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects.     This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards, Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an         outputs.
  
 - L298n:
  One of the easiest and inexpensive way to control DC motors is to interface L298N Motor Driver with Arduino. It can control both speed and spinning         direction of two DC motors. The L298N is a dual-channel H-Bridge motor driver capable of driving a pair of DC motors. That means it can individually       drive  up to two motors making it ideal for building two-wheel robot platforms. The module can drive DC motors that have voltages between 5 and 35V,       with a peak current up to 2A. The L298N motor driver module is powered through 3-pin 3.5mm-pitch screw terminals. It consists of pins for motor             power supply(Vs), ground and 5V logic power supply(Vss).
  
  -MG90S: 
    MG90S is a micro servo motor with metal gear. This small and lightweight servo comes with high output power, thus ideal for RC Airplane, Quadcopter or     Robotic Arms.
    
  - 3d printed part:
    were using a 3d printed part so we can attatch the micro server motor with lego parts to control the car.
